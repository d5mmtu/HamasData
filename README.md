MoH long reports have been added up to June 2024. The Reference Document has not been updated for some time now. Recent focus has been on:

(1) UNRWA data, expanding work by Mark Zlochin. I have more expansive UNRWA-data projections of casualties in the Gaza strip in 2023. Numerical simulations yield extremely high variance estimates, but these are likely still more accurate than MoH fabrications. Likely deaths for 2023 are actually higher than announced by MoH/GMO, but contain large numbers of Hamas fighters. Approx: 15k civilians, 10k Hamas. 1.5:1 Civ:Mil ratio. This would have improved in 2024. I should emphasise that these are all *extremely* low confidence estimates based on numerical simulations that yield large confidence intervals. The modelling itself is based on significant assumptions.

(2) Performance of financial markets over the period - TASE and US-listed ETFs ISRA and EIS (incl. capital flows as well as prices). The recovery since October suggests markets initially factored in a high probability of a regional conflict, but this possibility retreated during October and did not significantly increase even with the Israel-Iran missile exchanges. US Naval activity in the Mediterranean was highly correlated with market movements, suggesting US deterrence was effective.
