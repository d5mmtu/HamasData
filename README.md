COMMENT 14/03/23 (2):
The previous version of the appendix (version 12/03/24) has been deleted. The new version (14/03/24) has been uploaded. This new version addresses the issue mentioned in the comment below, and also adds some text in a few passages of the document to make the explanations clearer. No numbers or analyses have been changed other than harmonising the Hamas data entry error previously treaded differently in Table 5.5 vs Sections 10 & 11 (see comment below). TO DO: I want to improve the analysis in Section 2 to incorporate some tabulations of data. I have Excel spreadsheets for this data but they're expansive and will be hard to render into Word tables. But it can be done. This should be in the next update.

COMMENT 14/03/23/ (1):
Hamas Ministry of Health has a data error in their long report dated 31-Dec-23. The report claims that the 21,978 total comes from 15,349 hospital-registered deaths and 6,929 media sources deaths. However, this adds to 22,278. Subsequent analysis of 2024 GMO data shows the 6,929 figure is in error, not the total. We use the (apparently correct) 6,629 figure in Sections 10 and 11, with an explanation in the Notes to the relevant tables. However, the 6,929 figure is used in Table 5.2 of Section 5.2 (again with the inconsistency noted in the table footnote). Thec Section 5 figure is totally inconsequential to analysis but I will harmonise it in next update with the S10 and S11 figures for consistency.
