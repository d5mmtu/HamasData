NOTE 14/03/23: Hamas Ministry of Health has a data error in their long report dated 31-Dec-23. The report claims that the 21,978 total comes from 15,349 hospital registered deaths and 6,929 media sources deaths. However, this adds to 22,278. Subsequent analysis of 2024 GMO data shows the 6,929 figure is in error, not the total. We use the (apparently correct) 6,629 figure in Sections 10 and 11, with explanation in the Notes to the relevant tables. However, the 6,929 figure is used in Table 5.2 of Section 5.2 (again with the inconsistency noted in the table footnote). Thec Section 5 figure is totally inconsequential to analysis but I will harmonise it in next update with the S10 and S11 figures for consistency.
